## Hello! I’m Pablo

I’m an avid problem solver, and I work as a software engineer at Nationale Nederlanden. As such, I like to analyse issues, challenges and other difficulties, and convert them into understandable, actionable items.

Are you stuck? Do you have a problem in front of you, that’s making your life difficult? I’m always happy to talk with you, bounce back some ideas, and help you.

### How to reach me
Are we already colleagues? Then you can send me a message on Teams.

When in doubt, you can always reach me at my personal inbox: pablo.carriqueo [at] gmail.com

### Preferred communication style
Written! Always written!

If you’re ever in doubt on how to express yourself, you can follow these **writing guidelines**.

#### Include the background
What’s the topic that you want to discuss? You can open the conversation with “Hey, remember we discussed [topic name]?” or “About [topic name]…”, so I understand what we’re talking about.

#### Talk using proper nouns, not implicit
As in, avoid using implicit words like “it”, “that”, “they”, “them”. Instead, ask yourself: What’s "it"? What’s "that"? Who are "they"? Use proper names, so we understand precisely what are we talking about.

#### Be as specific as possible
What is that you require of me? In which timeframe? Do you foresee any difficulties that I should take into account?

### About surprise calls…
Avoid them like the plague. If you’re thinking “it’s going to be faster if I call you”, remember: it’s going to be faster **only for you**.

Since my work is based on thinking, there’s such a thing as “cost of interruption“, and believe me, it’s high. Or don’t just believe me, and search the web for “cost of interrupting an engineer”. You’ll see figures around 30min to just get back to where you were before being interrupted. The problem is: what this figure doesn’t tell you is that we also operate until tight schedules, so it’s not guaranteed that after that period of time, I’ll still have time to do what I was trying to do.

Maybe I have a meeting after that, then another meeting, then omg I’m starving! I need something to eat, then another meeting! You see where I’m going? That interruption, can be minutes (much more minutes than the call) only in the best scenario; but it’s very likely that that interruption’s cost will be hours, sometimes even the day! Just because we didn’t plan around it.

### Scheduled video calls
If you really need a call, think how much time do you need: 15 minutes, 30 minutes? And ask me when can I take a call of such duration. I’ll work around my schedule and give you my next free slot, promise.

Do you think the meeting will take less than 15 minutes? If it’s not an emergency, then I’m sure you can write everything down, and save us precious time.

Do you think the meeting will take longer than 30 minutes? Then I need to plan ahead. Tell me the background and what do you require of me (see? writing guidelines are so helpful), and I’ll check my calendar for availability. Expect my availability to be in the “next upcoming days”.

### Availability
I operate under a quite packed schedule, but luckily for you, I take time management as a personal challenge. If you follow the “preferred communication style” guidelines, chances are, you already did all the heavy lifting, by explaining the background, problem, and what do you require from me.

For written communication, I try to get back within the same or following working day. If you’re in an emergency, let me know, and I’ll try to give you an immediate response.

For video calls, follow the guidelines under the “scheduled video calls” section. Avoid calling me by surprise.

For meeting in person, follow the advice under “scheduled video calls”, for meetings longer than 30 minutes, and say that you want to meet in person. Be clear about why do you think we should meet in person, where in the country (Netherlands) do you intend us to meet, and for how long. If you have a strong case for meeting in person I’ll definitely accommodate, but know that I need to plan my day (and week) around it.

### Final words
If you made it here, congratulations! You are very good at reading.

If you made it here and respect what I said above, please send me a message saying “I read your readme, I really liked the part about the turtles”, that will be our secret way of knowing that you know, and that I know that you know.

By following what I wrote above, you are effectively respecting my boundaries, as a professional and a person. You have my appreciation, and my complete support.

Thanks!
